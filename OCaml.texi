@node Audience, Overview, Preface, Preface
@unnumberedsec Intended Audience

Who should read  this document?  First, what is literate  programming? To begin
this conversation, it is just as important to understand what it is not as what
it is. It is @emph{not}  @b{documentation}.  It is, rather, a @emph{programming
paradigm}, or  perhaps a @emph{programming  meta-language} sitting on top  of a
conventional programming language.  Here are a few quotes to set the context:

@quotation
@sansserif{Read your  first page: YOU  GOT IT TOTALLY  WRONG. Literate
programming is NOT about documentation in the first place.  All quotes
you  tore  out  speak  of  literate programming  as  if  it's  just  a
documentation system.  While it is not.}

@sansserif{Literate programming  is a PROGRAMMING PARADIGM,  or if you
wish a "META-LANGUAGE",  on top of machine-coding  language, which was
created with the purpose of: a) allowing humans to create abstractions
over abstractions over abstractions with  macros (which are phrases in
a human language  and if you wish are precise  "new operators" in that
meta-language, created  on the fly). b)  this system of macros  can be
created  not  in machine  demanded  order,  but  as need  for  logical
thinking.   Later  it  is  reshuffled  ("tangled",  i.e.   convoluted,
scrambled) from the natural into the inhuman machine codes.}

@sansserif{You  totally missed  the idea,  and  in the  case of  blind
leading  the   blind  quote  scores  of   other  misreaders.  Literate
programming is not  a documentation system per se,  it's a programming
paradigm.}

@author Astonished Reader @mybibcite{LitProg:Home}
@end quotation

It is literature  teaching people about a  very complex system, i.e.,  a set of
symbols intended for  humans about a set  of symbols intended for  a machine to
interpret and turn into action.

@quotation
@sansserif{Let us change our  traditional attitude to the construction
of programs: Instead of imagining that  our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us  concentrate rather on explaining to human
beings what we want a computer to do.}
@author Donald Knuth @mybibcite{LitProg:Knuth}
@end quotation

@quotation
@sansserif{Literate programming  is the art of  preparing programs for
human readers.}
@author Norman Ramsey @mybibcite{LitProg:Ramsey}
@end quotation

Literate programming  is a  programming paradigm  or meta-language  that allows
greater abstraction than the programming language itself; it is a paradigm that
is based  upon the logical needs  and understandings of the  programming author
speaking to programming  readers (including him or herself), while  at the same
time,  in parallel,  it is  a  paradigm or  meta-language designed  to allow  a
computer system to  @emph{tangle} the programming author's ideas  into a system
that  is understood  and  processed by  a machine  according  to the  machine's
requirements: machine code.

In the case  of literate programming via the  @file{TexiWebJr} system, however,
there is the added advantage that  during the @emph{weaving} process the author
is producing two  dual abstractions for readers: @b{nodes}  (via an @file{Info}
file)  and  @b{sectioning}  (via   a  hyperlinked  @file{Pdf}  document),  each
inherently independent  yet working in concert  to produce at one  and the same
time  both graph-based  and chapter-based  output, each  with its  own inherent
strengths  and  advantages.  The  @file{TexiWebJr}  system  goes even  further,
however, in  producing a  third output which  is a hybrid  of both  systems, an
@acronym{HTML}  form (via  an @acronym{HTML}  web  site) that  combines both  a
sectioning output  and a graph-based  output.  You  have your choice  of graph,
sectioning, and combined,  all of which is fully  indexed and cross-referenced,
from one  source file.

It  is an  inherent aspect  of literate  programming that  there is  always one
source document,  so that by  changing any one part  of the system,  the author
updates all  forms of  output at  one and the  same time.   It is  perhaps this
aspect of  literate programming  that causes the  confusion with  thinking that
literate  programming  is  solely   about  @emph{documentation}.   In  reality,
however, that  is just one  aspect of literate  programming; the real  point of
literate programming  is that the author  can attack the problem  of creating a
complex system from an abstract logical position disconnected to a large degree
from the  requirements of  the computer  machine and present  the problem  to a
reader in a way  that will provide true understanding with  less effort than if
the reader had to understand the system from the computer's point of view

And finally, I use  literate programming as a form of  education.  It allows me
to  take a  complex situation  and break  it down  into hierarchies  of simpler
parts, but at  the same time provide links and  cross-references and indices to
tie the complex  system together into a web of  inter-related parts, which form
the whole.  Using this form of literate programming, I can create one big whole
system, and iteratively rework it into a web of inter-related parts that inform
my growing understanding  of the system as a whole,  while never destroying the
system's inherent  integrity to operate as  a functional machine.

In summary, I see the advantages of literate programming to be immense and that
far outweigh the  relatively high cost of  learning how to do it  (which is for
certain a life-long endeavor in itself).  Therefore, dear Reader, this document
is intended for human  consumption.  If you are a machine,  please refer to the
tangled mess that has  been prepared for you as source  code.  Whoever you are,
enjoy.  Cheers.

# MY TWJR TEMPLATE

## About This Source File

This  document (`my_template.twjr`)  is  a *literate*  source  document. It  is
designed to produce an `Info` file (best read from within Emacs, but there is a
stand-alone Info  reader that can  be used),  a `Pdf` document  (generated from
LaTeX source  code by PDFTeX),  an `HTML` web  site, `Docbook` source  code, an
`XML`  document, and  a  plain text  document. In  addition.  it also  produces
working  code   in  any  language  (so   long  as  your  system   contains  the
infrastructure to  run the code). For  example, this `README` file  was drafted
within this source document  and extracted as a separate file,  as was also the
`Makefile`.  This *literate*  document's  features are  targeted  via a  custom
`Makefile` that is  also a part of  this document, and extracted  as a separate
file, and is dynamic in the sense that  if you update it, you can produce a new
version with  a simple call to  a `make` target. It  is designed to be  able to
produce any  number of working software  packages of any language  contained at
any  number of  different  locations on  your  system, all  with  a single  or,
alternatively, multiple `make` calls, depending on the granularity you need.

The Github  repository contains this  source document,  a Makefile that  can be
used  to work  with the  project, as  well as  a `Texinfo`  file that  has been
generated from  this `Twjr` file,  this README,  and a `.gitignore`  file. Most
computer systems have or can easily get the `make`, and `texinfo` programs that
are needed to  process the `Texinfo` file into the  various end documents, such
as `Info`,  `Pdf`, `HTML`, etc. Your  system will need, in  addition to `make`,
and `texinfo`, Gnu  AWK (`gawk`), and TexiwebJr to make  changes to this source
document and  process it  into a  `Texinfo` file and  extract its  programs and
files.  Your system  should also  have  the equivalent  of Bash  version 4,  as
version 4  has some parameter capabilities  that earlier versions do  not. Note
that most  versions of Mac OS  have version 3  of Bash installed as  a default.
Version 4 can be added using Homebrew or MacPorts very easily. In the past, Mac
OS has  also shipped with a  version of `texinfo`  that is below 6.5.  You will
also need to update `texinfo` to at least 6.5 if that is the case.

@node Conventions,  , Overview, Preface
@unnumberedsec Typographical Conventions

@c Copied mostly verbatim from the gawk manual.

@cindex Texinfo document formatting language
This @value{DOCUMENT} is written in an enhanced version of
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/, Texinfo},
the GNU documentation formatting language.
A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online
versions of a program's documentation.
@ifnotinfo
Because of this, the typographical conventions
are slightly different than in other books you may have read.
@end ifnotinfo

Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common
shell primary and secondary prompts, @samp{$} and @samp{>}.  Input that
you type is shown @kbd{like this}.  Output from the command is preceded
by the glyph ``@print{}''.  This typically represents the command's
standard output.  Error messages, and other output on the command's
standard error, are preceded by the glyph ``@error{}''.  For example:

@example
$ @kbd{echo hi on stdout}
@print{} hi on stdout
$ @kbd{echo hello on stderr 1>&2}
@error{} hello on stderr
@end example

@ifnotinfo
In the text, command names appear in @code{this font}, while code segments
appear in the same font and quoted, @samp{like this}.  Options look
like this: @option{-f}.  Some things are emphasized @emph{like this},
and if a point needs to be made strongly, it is done @strong{like this}.
The first occurrence of a new term is usually its @dfn{definition} and
appears in the same font as the previous occurrence of ``definition''
in this sentence.  Finally, file names are indicated like this:
@file{/path/to/our/file}.
@end ifnotinfo

@heading What Is Caml?
Caml is  a general-purpose programming  language, designed with  program safety
and reliability in mind. It is very expressive, yet easy to learn and use. Caml
supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles. It has
been  developed  and distributed  by  INRIA,  a  French research  institute  in
computer science and applied mathematics, since 1985.

@heading OCaml
The OCaml system is the main implementation of the Caml language. It features a
powerful module system and a  full-fledged object-oriented layer. It comes with
a  native-code   compiler  that  supports  numerous   architectures,  for  high
performance; a bytecode compiler, for increased portability; and an interactive
loop, for experimentation and rapid development.

@heading Caml Light
The Caml Light system is an  older, lightweight implementation of the core Caml
language. It  is obsolete, no longer  actively maintained, and will  be removed
eventually. We recommend switching immediately to its successor, OCaml.

@heading Resources for Caml Users
In  addition to  the official  distribution of  the Caml  compilers, this  site
provides a collection  of online resources that are useful  to Caml users, from
beginners to  expert programmers.  Most of  them were  contributed by  the very
active community of Caml programmers.

@subsection About Caml In Depth

@url{http://caml.inria.fr/about/index.en.html}

Caml is  a general-purpose programming  language, designed with  program safety
and reliability in mind. It is very expressive, yet easy to learn and use. Caml
supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles.

The Caml language has been developed since 1985 at INRIA by the Formel, Cristal
and Gallium teams. Caml Light, which was developed in the early 1990s, is still
in use today, especially in education. OCaml offers a richer programming
language as well as efficient native code compilers for many architectures. A
more detailed history of Caml is available.

@subheading Strengths
Both implementations of Caml offer:
@itemize
@item
@b{A  powerful type  system}, equipped  with parametric  polymorphism and  type
inference. For instance,  the type of a collection can  be parameterized by the
type of  its elements. This allows  defining some operations over  a collection
independently of  the type of  its elements: sorting  an array is  one example.
Furthermore, type inference  allows defining such operations  without having to
explicitly provide the type of their parameters and result.
@item
@b{User-definable  algebraic data  types and  pattern matching}.  New algebraic
data types can  be defined as combinations of records  and sums. Functions that
operate over  such data structures can  then be defined by  pattern matching, a
generalized form of  the well-known switch statement, which offers  a clean and
elegant way of simultaneously examining and naming data.
@item
@b{Automatic  memory management},  thanks to  a fast,  unobtrusive, incremental
garbage collector.
@item
@b{Separate  compilation   of  stand-alone  applications}.   Portable  bytecode
compilers allow  creating stand-alone applications  out of Caml Light  or OCaml
programs. A foreign function interface allows  Caml code to interoperate with C
code  when  necessary.  Interactive  use  of  Caml  is  also  supported  via  a
“read-evaluate-print” loop.
@end itemize
In addition, OCaml features:
@itemize
@item
@b{A   sophisticated   module   system},  which   allows   organizing   modules
hierarchically and parameterizing a module over a number of other modules.
@item
@b{An  expressive object-oriented  layer}, featuring  multiple inheritance  and
parametric classes.
@item
@b{Efficient  native code  compilers}. In  addition to  its bytecode  compiler,
OCaml  offers  a  compiler  that  produces  efficient  machine  code  for  many
architectures.

@subheading A Widely Used Programming Language

The  Caml language  was initially  used  to develop  applications that  involve
symbolic computation:  automatic theorem  provers, compilers  and interpreters,
program  analyzers, etc.  It is  now  used to  develop software  in many  other
application   areas.   This   is   illustrated  by   our   list   of   selected
@url{http://caml.inria.fr/about/successes.en.htmlm success stories}.

The Caml  language is  widely used  for teaching programming.  It is  also used
inside  academic projects  in Europe,  Asia,  and the  Americas. Several  large
corporations develop  significant industrial  projects in OCaml:  these include
Dassault Systèmes, Microsoft, IBM, and CEA (Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique).

The @url{http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/index.en.html, Caml consortium} offers
industrial and  academic partners a  formal framework for participating  in the
development,  maintenance, and  evolution  of Caml.  Partners  also enjoy  very
liberal licensing conditions regarding the Caml software distribution.

@subheading How to Get the Caml Compilers?

The  Caml compilers  developed  at INRIA  are Open  Source  software. They  are
available free of charge.

@heading Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml

@cindex functional programming paradigm
Functional programming  is a programming  paradigm which is  rapidly attracting
interest  from  a  broad  range  of  developers  because  it  allows  to  write
expressive, concise and elegant programs.

In this MOOC you will learn  Functional programming using the OCaml programming
language.You will  discover the powerful  mechanisms that are offered  to build
and manipulate  complex data structures in  a clean and efficient  way. And you
will see how functions  play a central role, as first-class  values that can be
freely used in any place where an expression can appear.

@cindex Robin Milner
@cindex ML
The OCaml programming language is a  member of the ML language family pioneered
by  Robin Milner.  An important  feature  of OCaml  is that  it reconciles  the
conciseness and flexibility of untyped  programming languages (like Python, for
example) with  the safety of  strongly typed programming languages  (like Java,
for example).  The OCaml compiler performs  in fact a type  inference. Types of
identifiers do not have to be declared  but are inferred by the compiler at the
moment  of  definition of  an  identifier,  and  then  used for  assuring  type
correctness when using an identifier.

@cindex multi-paradigm language
We will  start by using OCaml  as a purely functional  programming language. At
the  end of  this MOOC  we will  see  that OCaml  is in  fact a  multi-paradigm
language which allows you to combine  the functional programming style with the
imperative programming paradigm.

@subsection SEPTEMBER 17, 2018

We  are  happy  to welcome  you  to  this  MOOC  on functional  programming  in
OCaml. This is the  third session of the course, that was  first run in October
2015, and has been improved taking into account the feedback we received.

This  starting week  is composed  of  two chapters,  named  week 0  and week  1
respectively,  and is  a kind  of  a warm  up.  Take your  time to  familiarize
yourself  with the  FUN platform,  the  grading environment,  and the  internal
forum. For instance, what about introducing yourself, your motivations, or your
expectations in the Coffee room section of the internal forum ?

In the  first chapter, namely "Introduction  and overview", you will  find some
history and motivation behind Functional Programming, and learn about the OCaml
ecosystem in general. But, let's start this  MOOC with a greetings video by our
guest Xavier Leroy!

In the  first chapter, namely "Introduction  and overview", you will  find some
history and motivation behind Functional Programming, and learn about the OCaml
ecosystem in  general. This  MOOC starts  with a greetings  video by  our guest
Xavier Leroy, the creator of the OCaml language!

In the first part  of the second chapter, you will learn how  to use OCaml as a
(very  rigorous and  expressive)  calculator, writing  simple expressions  over
basic data types. For this part, you  will be able to test your knowledge using
quizzes. There  is a lot of  quizzes but only half  of them count in  the final
grade; so don't be  afraid and do not let them drive you  crazy! You might also
skip them  and come back  later. Their purpose is  mostly to let  you challenge
your  knowledge   of  various   corner  cases---well   lets  say   oddities  or
originalities---in the  OCaml syntax  than to blame  mistakes: for  each graded
quizz, you  have three  attempts and  some hints are  provided after  the first
attempt.

Then, in the second part, you will learn how to write your first functions. You
will be able to test your  knowledge using actual programming exercises, in the
integrated grading  environment. Patience, this  will be much less  boring than
the quizzes!

In this second part,  there is also a video from  Kathleen and Arthur Breitman,
the creators  of Tezos, one of  the most innovative blockchain.  You will learn
why they decide to make the infrastructure of Tezos crucially depends on OCaml.

All programming  exercises count into the  final grade (except, each  week, the
exercise with  the lowest grade)  but there is no  limitation in the  number of
submissions. You have until  the end of the course to  submit your answers, and
you can observe your progression in the Progress tab.

And, as our guest star Xavier Leroy says, have fun!

Hello and welcome to the second week of this course.

Last week, you  learned how to write simple expressions  over basic data types,
and  how  to  write  simple  and even  recursive  functions.  We  continue  our
exploration  of the  OCaml  programming  language :  you  will manipulate  data
structures built using  those previously introduced basic data  types, but also
learn to define and  use your own types so they best fit  the problems you want
to solve with functional programming.

With data types that can contain one or  more basic values, you will be able to
solve small puzzles in the exercises, and finally to implement a small database
that leverages the type safety of OCaml.

This week too, we have a welcome video message. This time, it is from OCamlPro,
the guys who did most of the technical support for this MOOC!

Have fun!


@c .....................................

@node OCTOBER 01 2018, OCTOBER 08 2018, SEPTEMBER 24 2018, News Updates
@subsection OCTOBER 01, 2018

At this point in the course, you should  be able to use data structures such as
tuples, records, or arrays to solve  small problems. The final exercise of last
week, about a  typed database, is a  good test to actually use  all you learned
since the beginning of this course.

This week, you will learn more about  defining your own datatypes, and use them
in conjunction with recursion. This will enable you to write programs that take
full advantage of  the combination of these  two features, which is  one of the
bigger strength of functional programming.

Enjoy this new week's content and get ready for a new set of exercises!

@subsection OCTOBER 08, 2018

This week  we are  going to  explore what can  be done  when one  starts taking
seriously the  possibility of functions  as first  class citizens, that  can be
passed as arguments, or computed  as results. Higher order functions (functions
that can take  functions as arguments, and  return them as results)  are at the
core of  functional programming: they  provide an  elegant and powerful  way of
solving and thinking  about problems. They allow to define  computations on the
data structures  we have seen  last weeks  by reasoning about  those structures
instead of defining concrete steps that change the state of the data.

@node OCTOBER 15 2018, OCTOBER 22 2018, OCTOBER 08 2018, News Updates
@subsection OCTOBER 15, 2018

Until now, we've mainly used OCaml  to perform "pure" computations, that do not
have  side  effects  or  interactions  with the  environment.  For  real  world
programs, one  have to deal  with computations  that have side  effects, handle
exceptional behavior  using exceptions,  and get  information in  and out  of a
program, ...

With side effects  also come mutations. The OCaml  programming language offers,
additionally to the functional style,  some imperative constructs that allow to
easily  write  the  algorithms  that  happen  to  be  more  naturally  or  more
efficiently implemented in an imperative style.

Welcome to  the final week  of this course  of functional programming  with the
OCaml language!

Up to now, we have explored most  of the core features of OCaml: writing simple
expressions or higher order functions, manipulating complex data structures, or
handling side effects and exceptions have  now become familiar to you. It's now
time  to see  how to  structure your  OCaml code  when you  write longer,  more
complex programs, and how to create  the data abstractions that are needed when
programming in  the large: modules  are a  great language construct  that OCaml
makesavailable just for  that, and we are  going to explore them  this week. We
will also  survey some of the  OCaml tools, so that  you will be able  to write
your first  real world OCaml projects,  outside of the exercise  environment in
the web browser  that has accompanied us  all along the course And  as an added
bonus, you  can watch these two  last guest videos from  companies and projects
that found OCaml essential for their developments!

Remember: next week we will unveil the final project!

@subsection OCTOBER 29, 2018

Welcome to the final project: the time has  come to try your hands on some real
programming task!

To finish the course, we offer you a choice among two projects.

@enumerate
@item
In the first, A Solver for Klotski,  you will write a generic solver for puzzle
games,  and then  instanciate it  to solve  the game  of Klotski.  You will  be
rewarded with an  animation of your solution! This project  uses vocabulary and
concepts  that make  it  more suited  for computer  science  students.

@item
In the  second, Random Text  Generation, you will write  a program that  uses a
Markov chain  approach (yes,  the same Markov  chains as in  the TV  series) to
generate random  sentences that reuse  parts of an  input text corpus  (or even
mixes  parts  of several  ones).   You  will be  rewarded  with  lots of  funny
sentences!  This project  is a  bit easier  and has  less prerequisites.   Both
projects can be done using the integrated  OCaml environment. So have a look at
both texts and  choose the one you prefer!  You can also do both,  but it won't
give you extra points.

Expressions  compute   values,  they   play  a   central  role   in  functional
programming.  This  sequence shows  some  basic  constructions of  expressions:
conditionals  and  function   application.  We  also  show   some  examples  of
polymorphic operators.

@node Makefile Variable Definitions, Makefile Default Target, The Makefile, The Makefile
@appendixsec Makefile Variable Definitions

The @env{SHELL} variable is included because some shell commands depend upon
Bash version 4, which is not native on my system.

The @env{ROOT} variable is designed to allow you to to extract the source files
(not the @acronym{TEXI}, @acronym{INFO}, @acronym{PDF} or @acronym{HTML} files,
but  the  programs defined  inside  the  @acronym{TWJR}  file) to  a  directory
structure outside of the your  ``present working directory'' (@env{PWD}) should
that be something you want to do, i.e., for production purposes.

The @code{FILE} variable  is the name of this source  @code{TWJR} file, without
extension.

The @code{FILES} variable is the name of  the root directory for the files that
are extracted during the @emph{tangling} phase.  This directory goes underneath
the @file{ROOT} directory.  Feel free to name this whatever you want.

The @code{LODESTONE}  variable is an empty  reference file that is  used solely
for its  modification time  to help  the Makefile  determine when  to recompile
(i.e., @emph{tangle} and @emph{weave}) the  source @file{TWJR} file.  It should
not be changed or otherwise touched (pun intended).

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Makefile Default Target, Makefile TWJR Targets, Makefile Variable Definitions, The Makefile
@appendixsec Default Target
@cindex default target

The @code{default} target  extracts all source files and moves  them into their
proper  directories,  and  processes  the   @code{TEXI}  source  file  into  an
@code{INFO}  file, a  @code{PDF} document,  and an  @code{HTML} web  site. This
process automatically updates the TEXI's nodes and sectioning commands prior to
generating  the   INFO,  PDF,  and   HTML  documents.    What  used  to   be  a
manually-intensive process is now completely  automated through a Makefile that
is extracted from the @code{TWJR}  source.

This  automated  process  depends   upon  the  programmer's  system  containing
@file{GNU   AWK}  (for   the   primary  literate   programming  operations   of
@emph{tangling}   and   @emph{weaving}@footnote{No  other   implementation   of
@file{AWK}  will  work}),   @file{make}  (to  control  the   build  and  output
processes@footnote{While I haven't tested it, just about any @file{make} should
work}),  @file{Texinfo} of  at least  version 6.5  (for the  processing of  the
@file{TEXI} output file), @file{makeinfo} (to produce the @file{INFO} file from
the @file{TEXI}  file), and @file{Emacs}  (for the automatic updating  of nodes
and sectioning  command@footnote{Again, while I  haven't tested it,  just about
any @file{Emacs}  should work}).   With these  dependencies, everything  can be
compiled with a single call to @command{make} with no argument:

@example
$ make
@end example

Individual files and documents can also be targeted with simple calls such as:

@example
$ make html

$ make openhtml

$ make pdf

$ make openpdf

$make info

$ make openinfo

$ make distclean

$ make allclean
@end example

@noindent and so forth (just name a few).

The target  @code{twjr} is  the default, and  does everything  explicitly.  The
target @code{weave}  (or alternatively @code{texi})  will run just  the command
@command{jrweave}  on the  @file{TWJR} file  to produce  the @file{TEXI}  file,
which  is  directly  responsible  for  producing  the  output  files.   If  the
@file{TWJR}  source  file has  been  modified,  then @command{maked}  will  run
@command{jrtangle} first to update all source documents.

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Makefile TWJR Targets, Makefile Clean Targets, Makefile Default Target, The Makefile
@appendixsec TWJR Targets
@cindex TWJR targets

These targets are all related to processing the main source @acronym{TWJR} file
in some  way. The @file{make} target  @command{twjr} is the default  target and
runs each of the processes  @command{jrtangle} and @command{jrweave} to produce
source files,  a @acronym{TEXI} file,  an @acronym{INFO} file,  a @acronym{PDF}
document, and an @acronym{HTML} web site.  It only sources what is necessary as
@file{make} is designed to do.  Note that at this time, @emph{weaving} includes
automatic  menu and  node  updating  of the  @acronym{TEXI}  file,  so that  an
@acronym{INFO} file  can also be  generated without needing to  manually update
the  @acronym{TEXI} file  first  as used  to be  the  case. @file{make}  target
@code{info}     runs     @command{makeinfo},     target     @code{pdf}     runs
@command{pdftexi2dvi}, and target @code{html} runs @command{makeinfo --html}.

The default @file{twjr} target deletes all extraneous build and log files prior
to finishing.   If you want  to retain  the build and  log files, then  run the
target @file{twjrkeep} instead.

The  file  @file{.lodestone}   is  used  to  set  a  reference   time  for  the
@acronym{TWJR} file,  so that  if the @acronym{TWJR}  file changes,  new source
documents will be generated; otherwise, it  will simply be left alone. In other
words, if @file{.lodestone}  is older than @file{.twjr},  then @file{.twjr} has
been modified, and it should be @emph{tangled} and @emph{woven} first.  If it is
newer, then @command{make} will not recompile.

Should the @file{Makefile}  portion of the @file{TWJR} be modified,  then it is
important to  obtain a fresh copy  of the @file{Makefile} prior  to running any
target; therefore,  use the target  @command{make newmakefile} first,  then run
any desired target.

removes build  directories and log  files, but  not source files  (those inside
@file{files} directory,  e.g., @file{bin/} and and  @file{src/}) and associated
files and  programs inside  them.  The  @command{distclean} target  removes the
